## High Concept

### Elevator Pitch

A turn-based gladiator game where you improve your dice instead of your character.

### Game Vision

The player fights through a series of gladiator battles using a customizable six-sided die as their primary weapon. Instead of leveling up a character, players replace and upgrade the faces of their die, creating unique builds and strategies through different face combinations, equipment, and status effects.

Every decision should make the player think:

> "Which die face should I replace to make my build stronger?"

## Design Pillars

### 1. Build Crafting Comes First

The core progression of the game is not leveling up a character, but continuously improving and reshaping a six-sided die. Every new face should encourage players to think about new synergies and long-term build strategies.

---

### 2. Meaningful Decisions Every Turn

Combat should never become a repetitive sequence of choosing the same action. Players should constantly evaluate their available actions, current build, enemy state, and possible outcomes before making a decision.

---

### 3. Reward Creative Synergies

The most satisfying moments should come from discovering powerful combinations between die faces, equipment, spells, and status effects. Players should feel rewarded for building clever synergies rather than simply increasing damage numbers.

---

### 4. High Risk, High Reward

Powerful effects should often come with meaningful drawbacks. Players are encouraged to take calculated risks in exchange for the possibility of creating exceptionally powerful builds.

---

### 5. Easy to Learn, Hard to Master

The basic rules should be understandable within minutes, while mastering build optimization, resource management, and combat decisions should provide long-term depth.

## Core Gameplay Loop

The game revolves around a simple but highly replayable gameplay loop that constantly encourages players to improve their die and experiment with new builds.

### Battle

Players fight enemies in turn-based gladiator battles. During combat, every turn presents meaningful decisions through different available actions (such as attacking, defending, or casting spells). The outcome of these actions is determined by rolling the customized die.

### Earn Gold

Winning battles rewards the player with gold. Gold is the primary resource used to improve future runs.

### Preparation Area (Market)

After every battle, players enter a preparation phase.

This is not simply a shop, but a strategic decision space where players can improve their current build before the next fight.

The market offers only a limited number of randomly selected options each visit.

Players may:

- Buy new die faces.
- Buy equipment.
- Learn new spells.
- Skip the market entirely and save their gold for later.

Players are never forced to spend their resources.

### Modify the Die

Newly purchased die faces can replace existing faces on the six-sided die.

Choosing which face to replace is one of the most important strategic decisions in the game.

### Repeat

Players continue alternating between battles and preparation phases until they either defeat the final boss or lose the run.

## Dice System Philosophy

The die is the core of the player's progression. Instead of improving a traditional RPG character, players continuously reshape and optimize their six-sided die throughout a run.

> **You don't build a hero. You build a die.**

Each die face is more than a number. It represents a strategic choice that can interact with other faces, equipment, spells, and status effects to create powerful synergies.

The goal is not to collect the highest numbers, but to discover the strongest combinations.

### Design Principles

- Every die face should have a purpose.
- Synergies are more valuable than raw numbers.
- Powerful builds should emerge from smart decisions, not pure luck.
- Different runs should naturally encourage different builds.
- Players should constantly evaluate whether a new die face fits their current strategy.

The strongest moments in the game should come from discovering unexpected combinations and watching a carefully crafted build come together.

### Die Face Structure

Every die face is defined by a common set of properties.

- Name
- Rarity
- Price
- Action Type
- Value
- Primary Effect
- Secondary Effect (optional)
